# Simple Plasma Glucose/Insulin Model, Riggs Iodine Model and Bolies' Plasma Glucose Model

This repository contains code and documentation which explores three different physiological models: the Simple Plasma Glucose/Insulin Model, the Riggs Iodine Model and the Bolies' Plasma Glucose Model. Below is a brief introduction to each model and the work conducted in this project:

##Simple Plasma Glucose/Insulin Model

In this section of the assignment, we developed a simple plasma glucose/insulin model to simulate changes in insulin and glucose levels in response to external inputs. The model is represented by the following set of differential equations:
